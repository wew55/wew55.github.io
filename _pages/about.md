I am now a Ph.D. candidate in [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/Departments/Electrical-Computer/), [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/). My advisor is Prof. [Jun Yang](https://www.pitt.edu/~juy9/), and I am also co-advised by Prof. [Youtao Zhang](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~zhangyt/) from Department of Computer Science. I received my Bachelor's and Master's Degrees from School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China in 2011 and 2014. My main research interests include computer architectures, memory/storage system design for future computing systems with a focus on emerging memories, machine learning applications and hardware accelerators and GPU architectures, workload analysis with big data analytics techniques. 

My research work on resistive memory architecture was nominated as [Best Paper Candidate of ICCAD 2017](https://iccad.com/sites/iccad.com/files/2017%20ICCAD%20Awards%20Page.pdf), and also selected as a [Finalist Paper for NVMW Memorable Paper Award (NVMW 2018)](http://nvmw.ucsd.edu/2018/program/). 

I have interned at [Micron Technology](https://www.micron.com/) in Summer 2019, and [Comcast](https://corporate.comcast.com/) in Fall 2018. More information can be found on my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wew55/).
