I am now a Ph.D. student in [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/Departments/Electrical-Computer/), [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/). My advisor is Prof. [Jun Yang](https://www.pitt.edu/~juy9/), and I am also co-advised by Prof. [Youtao Zhang](https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~zhangyt/) from Department of Computer Science. I received my Bachelor's and Master's Degrees from School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China in 2011 and 2014. 

My research work on resistive memory architecture was nominated as [Best Paper Candidate of ICCAD'2017](https://iccad.com/sites/iccad.com/files/2017%20ICCAD%20Awards%20Page.pdf), and also selected as a Finalist Paper for NVMW Memorable Paper Award (NVMW2018). I am interning at Comcast in Fall 2018.
