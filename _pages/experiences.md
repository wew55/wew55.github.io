Work Experiences
------
__Micron Technology__, Folsom, CA, USA
* Intern - Emerging Memory Media Optimization
  - Memory behavior characterization and workload analysis for emerging applications. 
  - Demonstrated knowledge in computer architecture, memory system, big data analytics with Python and Spark.
* May 2019 - August 2019

__Comcast, Moorestown__, Moorestown, NJ, USA

Research Projects
------
__University of Pittsburgh__, Pittsburgh, PA, USA
* Durable ReRAM Crossbar based Neural Network Accelerator Design
  - Optimized weight updating schemes and programming strategies for enhancing write endurance of resistive crossbar based neural network accelerators.
* High Performance and Reliable Nonvolatile Memory Design
  - Performed pioneer study on the correlation between the write latency and data patterns stored in resistive memories. Proposed to shorten the write latency, and improved the lifetime for crossbar resistive memories. Proposed a read error resilient 2T4J (two-transistor-four-MTJ) MLC STT-MRAM based last-level cache design to achieve good tradeoff between reliability and capacity.
* Memory Design for Future GPUs
  - Studied and explored the GPU memory hierarchies and proposed a near-data processing architecture of GPU with Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) to achieve energy-efficient computing.
